# Domain Driven Design Based Enterprise Application Framework 

An opinionated Enterprise Application Framework based on different Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain Driven Design. Although not all tactical and strategic Patterns, Principles and Practices of DDD are in place but the most important ones (the ones that are used almost in any Enterprise app) are in place.

This framework is helpful in scenarios wherein one needs to interact with different Integration technologies using different .NET based access technologies (can be DBs, SOAP or RESTFUL Web Services or MQs or File System or an LDAP or any other imaginable data source).Another possible scenario can be in a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) environment wherein the commands are processed in an RDBMS like SQL Server whereas the queries are executed to fetch data from NOSQL Dbs. Also, once this framework is completed and if someone uses this framework, at least for the development of a SPA based Web Application or Website or a Mobile Web application, ideally he/or she should need to work only on Domain Modelling(i.e. mainly Domain, Domain Services and Application Services) and UI stuffs(there might be some requirement for extending some extensibility points which are already provided out of the box or creating new extensibility points all-together or some other configuration stuff changes required like DI container specific stuffs or ORM configurations if RDBMS is used etc.).That doesn't mean that all these can be applied only for Web apps or Websites or Mobile Web Application only but in-fact, parts of this framework can be applied to other types of applications as well e.g. Business Process Management and Integration projects as well.

DDD is more about domain modelling for complex domains using concepts of Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates etc. and separating out your Business functionalities from your technical functionalities. Although this framework provides(or will provide) most of the technical functionalities(out of the box, including the source code) used in an Enterprise app and some base level classes for dealing with Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates etc. but it's not necessary that one is going to need every bit of it. So use this framework (or may be just parts of the framework) diligently after analyzing the requirements for your app meticulously.

Implementation Overview-> 
Here the CommandRepository(for persisting data) and QueryableRepository(for querying data) are in-memory representation of some external source - mainly DBs(but can be extended to Web Services or MQ interactions as well or any other imaginable data source for that matter).
The CommandRepository class needs instances of concrete implementation of BaseUnitOfWork and ICommand which can be injected using some DI Framework like Unity.

UnitOfWork (implements IUnitOfWork members) - De-couples the logic to do atomic transactions across Dbs(can be extended to use Web Services/MQs or some other data source as well to be part of the Transaction) using different DB access technologies(again can be extended to use Web Service/MQs or any other data source). UnitOfWork based transactions can be applied at the API or Domain Services or Repository layer.

ICommand & IQuery- Provides contracts to deal with different DB technologies viz. ADO.NET, Enterprise Library or ORMs like Entity FrameWork Code First etc. and different DBs (current implementation supports mainly SQL Server - but as mentioned earlier also, can be extended to support other DB types as well).

N.B.-> If one wants to think of any imaginable data source as Repository then at least for the query side it's better to have a IQueryable provider for the same(at least to use this framework seamlessly). For an exhaustive list of open source IQueryable providers, one can visit [Linq to Everything](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/charlie/2008/02/28/link-to-everything-a-list-of-linq-providers/) (well, it's almost EVERYTHING).If some imaginable data source is not mentioned in the afore-mentioned list then one can build his/her own IQueryable provider and hopefully the articles viz. [LINQ: Building an IQueryable provider series](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mattwar/2008/11/18/linq-building-an-iqueryable-provider-series/), [Building Custom LINQ Enabled Data Providers](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tommer/2007/04/20/building-custom-linq-enabled-data-providers-using-iqueryablet/), [Creating LINQToTwitter library using LinqExtender](http://weblogs.asp.net/mehfuzh/creating-linqtotwitter-library-using-linqextender) and [Writing A Custom LINQ Provider With Re-linq](http://fairwaytech.com/2013/03/writing-a-custom-linq-provider-with-re-linq/) can be helpful in doing the same. And if anyone builds any LINQ to Something (or "Anything") provider, then please don't forget to share it with the world. Some other intriguing reads on LINQ are [Analytic Functions using LINQ](https://linq2db.github.io/articles/Window-Functions-%28Analytic-Functions%29.html), [SqlDependency Based Caching of LINQ Queries](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/141589/SqlDependency-based-caching-of-LINQ-Queries), [Dynamically evaluated SQL LINQ queries](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43678/Dynamically-evaluated-SQL-LINQ-queries) and [Building LINQ Queries at Runtime in C#](http://tomasp.net/blog/dynamic-linq-queries.aspx/).     

Pending Tasks ->

• Incorporation of some tactical DDD stuffs (mainly the common framework elements).

• Trying exploring and incorporating Dapper(a Micro-ORM - Micro ORMs may not provide you some functionalities like UnitOfWork out of the box like that of an ORM but performance wise they are way better compared to ORMs), Event Stores and Grid Based Storage.

• Incorporation of some Restful stuffs which are commonly used in most Enterprise Apps.

• Whatever done till now is all Orchestrations rather than Event Driven Choreographies. Even the async await based request reply mechanisms are also actually Orchestrations. True Fire and Forget Event Driven Choreographies (may be with some nominal acknowledgement   sent to the requester) following Eventually Consistent approach WILL ALSO BE TRIED, at the Web API Layer using "Event Driven Rest"     and at the Business Layer using [Zero MQ](http://zeromq.org/).[Zero  MQ](http://zeromq.org/) was designed from the ground up, keeping   in mind stock trading apps wherein very high throughput and very low latency are required, as discussed 
  [here](http://aosabook.org/en/zeromq.html).         
  N.B. -> One can refer the paper - [Your Coffee Shop Doesn't use 2 phase commit](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/IEEE_Software_Design_2PC.pdf) (written by the Integration genius - Gregor  Hohpe, co-   author of the Integration Bible viz. [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/)) to see how apps   can be implemented without using Transactional Consistency.

• Testing BulkOperations using SQL Express Edition.

• Fixing WCF related Unit Test Case(s).

• Redesign Caching stuffs to support in-memory caching or some scalable option like Windows AppFabric or Redis(a scalable NOSQL  option). Ideally, should be designed in a pluggable way to support any cool Caching mechanism coming in future as well. Also should use   some AOP or attribute (annotation) based approach to apply Caching or invalidating the Cache else it becomes very hectic to apply these   cross cutting concerns everywhere within a large application.
  
• Exploring Single Page Applications and building a Fluent UI Framework using which the UI layout (HTML + CSS) and UI Behaviors (using JavaScript) can be coded in a fluent way using JavaScript. IF POSSIBLE, will try to have plugin features wherein SPA Frameworks like Angular or React can be plugged in as and when required. Will also try to incorporate Offline-First capabilities. All     these probably will have a GitHub Project of its own and that will be used in this project.This is going to take quite some time since   lots of exploration needs to be done in this area.

• Ultimately building a SAAS Framework based on all the above stuffs.

• Fixing or suppressing the Warnings generated by MS Code Analysis Tool (currently, Code Analysis Settings is set to "Microsoft
  Basic Design Guidelines").

• Also need to run the Code Metrics to check everything is as per standards.

 ** Also, if at all this codebase is migrated to .NET Core then hopefully [ASP.NET Core Documentation](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/) and [Porting to .NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/10/porting-to-net-core/) will be pretty much helpfull.But currently lots of .NET Framework stuffs are not supported by the current .NET Core version as verified by [.NET Portability Analyzer Tool](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1177943e-cfb7-4822-a8a6-e56c7905292b).Also don't have any plans to have a mix and match of .NET Framework and .NET Core environment working together since that would have its own challenges(didn't do any thorough analysis though) and the whole point of using .NET(wholly) for LINUX/MAC is missing in such an approach(although one might suggest to deploy .NET Framework code as a Web Service deployed in a Windows machine while the .NET Core code deployed in some LINUX/MAC machine consuming the Web Service but for sure, that would have its own challenges).Anyways, that's secondary and so MIGHT be taken care at some later point of time.

    • Although the JavaScript world has been moving towards Object Orientation(ES6 and ES7) but the irony is that the traditional Object Oriented languages like Java, C# have been moving more towards the functional side and for functional approaches, one can refer(mainly JS and .NET based language resources) - [So you want to be a Functional Programmer](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-6-db502830403#.5noh8ieb8), [Functional Programming in C#](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Functional-Programming-in-C-Classic-Programming-Techniques-for-Modern-Projects.productCd-0470744588.html), [LINQ and Functional Programming via C#](http://weblogs.asp.net/dixin/linq-via-csharp), [Learning F#](http://fsharp.org/learn.html), [Functional JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do), [Functional Programming in Javascript](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/functional-programming-javascript) and [Persistent DataStructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure).For Patterns on Functional Programming, refer [FP Design Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I19uA-wGY), [Where are all the Functional Programming Design Patterns](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/89273/where-are-all-the-functional-programming-design-patterns)(Check for the answer by Corbin March) and [Does Functional Programming Replace GoF Design Patterns](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327955/does-functional-programming-replace-gof-design-patterns).

 ** One of the best way to learn SPA, REST/MicroServices and DDD (including CQRS and Event Sourcing) is to grab some existing good open source projects and then gather the requirements (from the source code), analyze the requirements, architect/design/implement the requirements (along with unit/integration/acceptance testing) using principles of SPA, REST/MicroServices and DDD (may be if needed, can apply parts/whole of this Framework for the same). Some intriguing open source projects in this regard are -        
 a) ASP.NET - [ASP.NET(& .NET in general) Open Source Projects](https://www.asp.net/mvc/open-source) and [ASP.NET Samples](https://www.asp.net/aspnet/samples).A good article with regards to comparison of various ASP.NET Technologies is [WEB FORMS, MVC, SINGLE PAGE APP, WEB PAGES COMPARISON](http://prasadhonrao.com/web-forms-mvc-single-page-app-web-pages-comparison/).              
 b) E-Commerce - [NopCommerce](http://www.nopcommerce.com/), [SmartStoreNET](https://www.smartstore.com/en/net) and [Virto Commerce](https://virtocommerce.com/)     
 c) Trading - [StockSharp](https://github.com/StockSharp/StockSharp) and [QuantConnect's Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean)     
 d) Telecom Billing - [jBilling](http://www.jbilling.com/)(the Cloud Computing billing model works somewhat in similar lines).[Managing Recurring Events In a Data Model](http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/technical-articles/again-and-again-managing-recurring-events-in-a-data-model) is a good read on a DB design approach for handling recurring events(any Billing system has some portions of it which can be visualized as recurring events).Also have a look into the related topics of [Dynamic Pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_pricing), [Pricing Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing_strategies) and [Price Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_optimization)(if possible, may be build some open source Pricing Framework).           
 e) CMS - [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) and [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/)       
 f) CRM - [SplendidCRM](http://www.splendidcrm.com/)

 o) Angular.JS - [Telerik's Showcase System](https://github.com/TelerikAcademy/ShowcaseSystem).Probably the best resource to learn SPA using Angular.js.  
 p) Monitoring - [Wolfpack Distributed System Monitoring](https://wolfpack.codeplex.com/).Again, this is not mentioned so that this monitoring project can be transformed into a project following all DDD principles but just mentioned so that people(who are not aware of this tool yet) can be aware of this awesome open source distributed system monitoring tool.          
 q) Some other stuffs(which might be useful) - Some other good code galleries(or projects) to watch out for are [.NET Core Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/tree/master/samples), [.NET Framework Technologies Samples](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb400848(v=vs.90).aspx), [MicroDot](https://github.com/gigya/microdot)([Samples](https://github.com/gigya/microdot-samples)),  [Hibernating Rhinos Git Repositories](https://github.com/hibernating-rhinos), [iDesign's Downloadables](http://www.idesign.net/Downloads), [Particular Software's Git Repositories](https://github.com/Particular), [Wintellect's Git Repositories](https://github.com/Wintellect), [HDInsight Git Repository](https://github.com/hdinsight), [Microsoft Mobius](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mobius)(somewhat like a .NET port of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)), [Grid Protection Alliance Repositories](https://www.gridprotectionalliance.org/technology.asp), [Jon Sequeira's Git Repositories](https://github.com/jonsequitur), [Reactive Streams](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-dotnet),[OpenScraping HTML Structured Data Extraction

 All the above stuffs are fine but how to scale ie. how to do fast processing of massive scale data(maybe terrabytes or petabytes or even more) for AI apps(may be some machine learning or NLP or some other app).Thats where the below mentioned Big Data concepts/technologies can be helpful -            
 Some good reference architectures on Big Data are [SMACK Reference Architecture for Big Data](http://datastrophic.io/data-processing-platforms-architectures-with-spark-mesos-akka-cassandra-and-kafka/), [SEI's Reference Architectures for Big Data Systems](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/05/reference-architectures-for-big-data-systems.html), [Big Data Analytics Reference Architectures](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-data-analytics-reference-architectures-facebook-sahu/).Some good references on Big Data in general are [Real-Time Stream Processing as Game Changer in a Big Data World with Hadoop and Data Warehouse](https://www.infoq.com/articles/stream-processing-hadoop), [Apache Kafka and Stream Processing O’Reilly Book Bundle](https://www.confluent.io/apache-kafka-stream-processing-book-bundle), [Confluent's Resources](https://www.confluent.io/resources/), [Designing Data Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net/), [Operating system support for warehouse-scale computing](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ms705/pub/thesis-submitted.pdf) and [Vijay Agneeswaran's Quora answers](https://www.quora.com/profile/Vijay-Agneeswaran).A concept very much related to Big Data is unstructured(& semi structured) data and some good articles/projects on these are [From Raw Data to Data Science: Adding Structure to Unstructured Data to Support Product Development](https://www.infoq.com/articles/raw-data-to-data-science), [UIMA Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UIMA), [Apache UIMA Project](https://uima.apache.org/) and [Dynamically building an unstructured information management architecture (UIMA) pipeline](https://www.google.ch/patents/US9280340).As far as specific technologies like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) are concerned, for [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) one can refer [Introduction to Apache Spark](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1023037/Introduction-to-Apache-Spark), [Apache Spark Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_spark/index.htm), [Data Algorithms](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033950.do), [Advanced Analytics with Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056591.do), [Mastering Azure Analytics](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050568.do), [Spark Internals](http://datastrophic.io/core-concepts-architecture-and-internals-of-apache-spark/) while for [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) one can refer [Apache Storm Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_storm/index.htm), [Learn it, then use it: Apache Storm](http://usefulstuff.io/2013/12/starting-point-for-apache-storm/), [Storm Applied](https://www.manning.com/books/storm-applied), [Storm Internal Implementation](http://storm.apache.org/releases/current/Implementation-docs.html).For .NETish resources on Big Data, one can refer [Trill - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trill/),[Stream processing using the Disruptor with C# and .NET](https://sequentialread.com/stream-processing-disruptor-csharp-dotnet/), [Big Data - Real-Time Data Analytics for .NET Developers Using HDInsight](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt614252.aspx), [DIY Stream Processing in C# with Events, Lambdas, DataTables, and StopWatches](https://weblogs.asp.net/sweinstein/diy-stream-processing-in-c-with-events-lambdas-datatables-and-stopwatches), [Introducing Stream Processing in F#](https://mikhail.io/2016/11/introducing-stream-processing-in-fsharp/), [Orleans Streams](https://dotnet.github.io/orleans/Documentation/Orleans-Streams/index.html), [Akka.NET Custom Stream Processing](http://getakka.net/articles/streams/custom-stream-processing.html).

 N.B. -> It’s not that I have read/viewed everything mentioned above but yes, I have read/viewed a few of them (partially or completely) and many are yet to be even started(for reading) but all the resources mentioned above are some of the best resources(as per my interaction with some beautiful minds and my own exploration). Also, something not mentioned in the above list doesn't mean that it's not good - only that I am not aware of(or not my preference).Also, once completed, this DDD framework can be considered (as a whole or in parts) as a Reference Architecture for quite a variety of application scenarios. Ultimate goal is to build an Omni-Channel Offline-First Single-Page-Application based SaaS Framework using DDD and Restful API concepts (although parts of the framework can be used for a BPM and Integration Project as well).

 P.S. -> In recent past, not been able to give any time for the development of this project for various reasons and don't think I will be able to contribute to this project anymore (not at least in near future).My Apologies! If someone can fork this project and continue working on the pending tasks or may be along with that, add his/her own ideas and implement the same that would be really great. Thanking that someone (if any), in advance.
